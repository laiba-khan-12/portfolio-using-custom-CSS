      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I am a passionate web developer with a love for creating modern and user-friendly websites.
        I specialize in front-end development, particularly using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, but I also
        have experience with back-end technologies like Node.js. My goal is to build fast, responsive,
        and beautiful web applications that provide excellent user experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am always excited to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy traveling, 
        photography, and exploring the latest design trends. My mission is to continuously challenge myself and
        create innovative solutions for my clients and users.
